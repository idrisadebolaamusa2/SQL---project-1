# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

1. To transform and analyze the ecommerce database using pg_admin. 
2. To answer questions by running codes and querying the database.
3. To help with insight into the ecommerce database.
4. To help us make key decisions based on customer spending patterns on the websites.


## Process

1. Loading csv files into Database
2. Data Cleaning
3. Answer the 5 questions in the starting_with_questions.md file. 
4. Generate 3-5 questions and answer them.
5. QA the Data
6. Generate ERD loading final table into PostgreSQL database


## Results
(fill in what you discovered this data could tell you and how you used the data to answer those questions)

Please find results in the **starting_with_questions.md** file

## Challenges 
(discuss challenges you faced in the project)

1. Cleaning the data as it was very messy.
2. Limited time.
3. I had a lot of issues deciding which tables to join for which specific question. It took a lot of my time. I ended up creating four (4) temporary tables.


## Future Goals

1. I would create new tables and re-assign the columns to tables where it makes more sense to keep them.
2. I would answer more questions with the data.
3. I would clean the data more so as to get more reliable answers.
